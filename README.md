# Zen-Watch: Watch youtube videos without any distractions

## Motivation
As soon as the college lectures began happening online, teachers have been uploading lectures over youtube.
Youtube has this awesome feature which shows you the videos that it thinks, you will love to watch.
While this has been a great feature when you are bored, it causes a lot of distraction when you want to focus on your lecture.

## Solution
So I created a web-application that allows you to watch youtube videos/playlist distraction free. 
You can just copy the link and start watching the lectures without the recommendations.
I also created a small chrome extension that allows you to move from youtube to zen-watch with single click.

* [Download the extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zen-watch/dlhfoeemfhhfpeiacamdplhpbemnceci?hl=en)

## Upcoming features
1. Search youtube for videos through webapp
2. Remember the previously watched videos
